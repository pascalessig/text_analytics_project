This was the final group project in the second semester from the Text Analytics course. 

Project description:
A market evaluation is known as a difficult and time consuming process, even though most of the unstructured data available is not included in it today and therefore holds a big potential to find growth opportunities within markets. This research aims to present an semi-automated approach to analyze descriptions of apps in the Google Play Store, by applying unsupervised methods to cluster them into groups and evaluate the clusters within a matrix, based on underlying performance measures. For that the Google Play Store was crawled to obtain the necessary information and textual similarities were identified, based on an LDA and Doc2Vec modelling approach. Both modelling results were clustered into segments with the k-means algorithm, in order to transform them into the business relevant measures, rating and number of downloads, to eventually interpret the meaning of the relative position they were mapped to. The modelling techniques were able to find textual similarities in a human-interpretable manner and revealed different levels of attractiveness for different app genres, based on the clustering. The findings of this pre-selection process helps to break down the sheer information available and reduce the necessary time to invest into a market evaluation.
